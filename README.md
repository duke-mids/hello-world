# Duke Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) Capstone Project

## Background: 

Provide a background to the project partner which helps identify context of the problem to be solved.

## Problem:  

The problem should clearly identify more specific context to the challenges faced by the partner and specific question that can be answered via some data-driven methodologies.

## Approach:  

Articulate a high level approach for which data science methodologies may be used to tackle the problem and give specific points of the project that will be made to indicate success.

To pursue this approach, the project team will:
+ Include some bulleted tasks that will need to occur in order for the project to be a success, e.g.:
+ Collaborate closely with the project partner to gain a better understanding of the existing process for challenges and how the data is currently collected
+ Perform the required pre-processing if the data to perform an analysis
+ Parse the text data and perform a thorough description analysis, identifying key trends and features. As part of the descriptive analysis, the project team will design visualizations that help "tell the story" of the analytics insights they uncover.
+ Engineer features that are likely to be predictive of the final outcome
+ Train a model to predict this final outcome. Some potential methods of predictions will include neural network and random forest
+ Test how the trained model performs on a hold-out data set
+ Characterize in which instances the model performs very well or very poorly. What caveats or assumptions should be made in reporting results?
+ Work with project partner developers and engineers to productionize the predictive model into the existing infrastructure.
	
## Data Set

What is the source of the data? What restrictions should be explicitly stated? What variables are included and what is the timeframe?


## Data Hosting and Computational Environment

Where will the data and compute be stored? PRDN? Personal machines? Business partner machines? Cloud? Secure VM?

## Content Transfer

If the data is being transferred, how will this be done? Duke Box? Dropbox?

## Deliverables

The project will be evaluated in a mid-year review, and will culminate in a comprehensive presentation that describes the methodology used in the project, results, and recommendations for the future.  An accompanying white paper will be provided with model details, assumptions, and data cleaning procedures.  All relevant slide presentations, code, data visualizations will also be provided to the project partner.   

## Allowable Reference to Project/Data Provider 

How can Duke students refer to the project partner / data provider?
Developed a prediction model to assess star ratings/resolution rate of a customer support session to help with deriving actionable insights such as enhanced expert training, selective session audit, etc.
